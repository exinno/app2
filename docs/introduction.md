# Introduction

## What is App2?

App2 is an innovative enterprise software platform that enables organizations to streamline their digital transformation journey with the power of no-code, low-code, pro-code, collaboration platform and generative AI. It's designed for users with varying levels of technical expertise and offers three approaches to software development: No-code for non-technical users, low-code for those with a basic technical background, and pro-code for expert developers who need complete control over the software development process.

App2 is unique in its ability to instantly build and modify complete applications using natural language commands. The platform provides real-time UI updates without requiring a refresh and supports a wide variety of data sources, including Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, as well as existing systems or other products. The platform model includes granular extension points that enable efficient customization of specific areas using technologies such as Vue.js, Node.js, and RESTful APIs. This allows users to develop and integrate their own components or services for efficient and unlimited customization of the platform.

In addition, App2 offers a self-hosted and on-premises option, giving users complete control over their infrastructure. The platform also plans to offer automated deployment to multi-cloud providers such as AWS and Azure, as well as a SaaS option in the near future.

## Key features of App2

- AI-code: AI-code is a groundbreaking feature of App2 that differentiates it from other products in the industry by generating entire screens and applications from natural language input. This is unlike other products that simply provide workflow recommendations or formulas. You can enter your requirements in natural language commands and the generative AI will quickly turn them into a working application. The application can be further customized using natural language, a visual designer, or code changes, making it accessible to everyone.
- No-code: You can build custom software in no time using pre-built components and importing data from Excel and other spreadsheets. It's as easy as a spreadsheet, but with the added benefit of being fully customizable and running on your own infrastructure.
- Low-code: For more experienced users who want more control over the code, App2 supports low-code development. You can modify the model in Visual Designer or using TypeScript, with changes reflected on the screen in real time.
- Pro-code: App2 allows developers to have maximum control over their application by writing code directly in TypeScript (or JavaScript). The platform also provides a powerful API and supports Vue.js and Node.js for further customization.
- Collaboration: App2's collaboration features are streamlined within the workspace for a seamless team experience. It includes content management, project management, messenger, and video conferencing features that allow team members to collaborate in real time no matter where they are located. By integrating collaboration tools, App2 streamlines the app development process, reducing the time and effort required to develop and test the app.

In summary, App2 is a versatile and easy-to-use platform that offers something for everyone, from non-technical users to experienced developers.

## Why App2?

Here are the top reasons why you should choose App2:

1. Multiple approaches to productivity: App2 allows organizations to develop applications in any combination of the most efficient ways using no-code, low-code, pro-code, and AI-powered app creation. For example, an organization can use no-code to create a basic order management system, low-code to add additional features, and pro-code to have full control over the app. AI-powered app creation also helps generate new ideas for apps, reducing the need for expensive brainstorming sessions or research.

2. Powerful and customizable apps: App2 enables customizable and powerful apps that meet unique business needs. It comes with a wide range of pre-built view and field components, including DataGrid, Pivot, List, and Dashboard. To extend the functionality of the platform, organizations can customize it with integrations and code extensions using low-code and pro-code, and access source code and templates to develop custom solutions on top of App2, allowing for unlimited customization using granular extension points and APIs. In addition, App2 provides real-time UI updates for multiple data sources, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Users can see changes made to the app using visual designers, making the development process more efficient. AI-powered app creation generates new app ideas, helping businesses stay ahead of the competition.

3. Model simplicity and flexibility: App2's model-driven approach provides a highly abstracted level of modeling, resulting in concise and flexible models. With support for inheritance and mixins, models can be easily reused, increasing their flexibility. For example, a DataGrid view integrates data model and form view definitions, requiring only one definition. Table schemas are automatically generated and updated, and fields can be easily added to form views without additional work. Mobile views are automatically optimized, with the List view created by default, and can be easily customized as needed. Developers can directly modify or visually edit App2's model code using the View Designer, giving them the flexibility to choose their preferred approach. Unlike other platforms that generate models and require manual editing of the data model, table view, form view, mobile view, and other areas to add columns, App2's model is well structured with runtime inheritance, allowing automatic updates to all related areas, making it more flexible and easier to maintain.

4. Support for code-based model maintenance: App2 allows developers to create and modify models using code in addition to the visual designer, which can lead to higher productivity. Unlike other products that restrict model creation to the designer, App2 supports TypeScript-based model creation that is fully integrated with VS Code. Save model code changes and they are immediately reflected in the running application without the need for an update. For example, developers can easily search and replace code and version control the entire app model code in their preferred Git repository. Type checking is also performed to prevent errors. They can also use App2's cloud-based IDE and DB tool, which provides a development environment equivalent to an on-premises development environment without the need to set it up separately. This approach provides an additional level of flexibility, allowing developers to work in a familiar environment that suits their needs. As a result, App2 gives developers greater control and productivity, making it an ideal platform for creating custom software.

5. Robust security: App2 provides a secure and reliable platform for organizations to develop custom software. The platform employs secure coding practices, file handling protocols, and database and transport encryption to prevent security vulnerabilities. It also provides robust and granular access controls, including user and role-based, object-based, attribute-based dynamic access controls, and comprehensive ACL management. Audit logs are generated for all user activity, providing traceability and accountability.

6. Versatile deployment options: App2 offers a self-hosted and on-premises option, giving organizations complete control over their infrastructure. In addition, the platform plans to offer automated deployment to multi-cloud providers such as AWS and Azure, as well as a SaaS option in the near future. This will allow organizations to choose the deployment option that best meets their needs.

In conclusion, with App2, you can quickly build custom applications, reduce costs, benefit from strong security and real-time collaboration, and streamline the application development process. With support for no-code, low-code, pro-code, and AI-driven app creation, App2 is the future of enterprise software development. Sign up today to experience the power of App2.
