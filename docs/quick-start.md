# Quick Start

Although App2 plans to support SaaS, Docker, and multi-cloud deployment in the future, these options are not currently available. For now, only the installation via npm package manager is provided.

## Pre-requirements

Before you start using App2, make sure you have the following pre-requirements:

- Operating System: Currently only supports Windows 7 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v9.6 or higher)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download/)

## Installation

To install App2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the App2 repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/app2/app2.git`.
2. Navigate to the 'app2' directory: `cd app2`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `yarn install`.
4. Build the project: `yarn build`.

## Database configuration

Once you have installed App2, you need to configure database before you can start using app.

1. Open the [app2.env](../app2.env) file in your 'app2' directory. This file contains environment variables that are used to connect to your database.
2. Use the connection string format to input the connection details for both PostgreSQL and Redis.

   If you don't have the connection details, you can follow the links below for detailed instructions on how to set up and configure PostgreSQL and Redis:

- [Redis Documentation: Getting Started with Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)
- [PostgreSQL Tutorial: Getting Started with PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/connect-to-postgresql-database/)

  Make sure to replace the placeholders in the connection string with your actual database credentials

```js
Connection string format:

APP2_PG=postgres://username:password@host:port/database
APP2_REDIS=redis://username:password@host:port

These environment variables are used to specify respective connection details.
```

3. To launch the server, users can either use the `yarn start` command in the 'app2' directory, or execute the app2-server.exe file located in 'app2/bin'.

## Create a new app

1. We can use container app to create new app. While app2 container server is running, go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

2. To login, use the admin ID and password provided in the ['users.csv'](../common/csv/users.csv).

3. Navigate to the "My Apps" section in the menu bar and click the "ADD" button in the action bar.

4. Fill in the details about the app, including any configurations that need to be set for the app.

## Building a app

After creating a new app, you can start the new app in one of two ways:

- Navigate to the 'server' directory and run `yarn start <app name>` to start the new app.

- Start the container server, then navigate to "My apps" in menu bar, select the created app, and click "START APP".

Click the 'Create View' button and select the method you want to build view.
