# Quick Start

Although App2 plans to support SaaS, Docker, and multi-cloud deployment in the future, these options are not currently available. For now, only the installation via npm package manager is provided.

## Pre-requirements

Before you start using App2, make sure you have the following pre-requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v9.6 or higher)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download/)

## Installation

To install App2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the App2 repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/app2/app2.git`.
2. Navigate to the 'app2' directory: `cd app2`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `yarn install`.
4. Build the project: `yarn build`.

## Database Configuration

Once you have installed App2, you need to configure database before you can start using app.

1. Open the [app2.env](../app2.env) file in your 'app2' directory.
2. If you have the connection details for PostgreSQL and Redis, enter them in the file using the format of a connection string. If not please refer to this [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/connect-to-postgresql-database/)

```js
APP2_PG=postgres://username:password@host:port/database
APP2_REDIS=redis://username:password@host:port
```

4. Start the server in the 'app2' directory using `yarn start` command this will run container server.

## Create new app

1. We can use container app to create new app. While app2 container server is running, go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

3. Navigate to the "My Apps" section in the menu bar and click the "ADD" button in the action bar.
